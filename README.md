# CVML-Dojo
This repository publishes problems to improve implementation skills related to computer vision and machine learning.
The goal is to deepen your understanding of CVML-related techniques through implementation and to ensure that you can implement them in job interviews.

<br></br>

You can create a local environment by running following commands.

```
conda create -n cvml python=3.11
conda activate cvml
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
